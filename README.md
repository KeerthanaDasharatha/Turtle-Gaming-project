# Turtle Crossing Game (Python - Turtle Graphics)

## Description:
Built an interactive arcade-style game using Python and Turtle graphics, inspired by the classic Frogger game. The project demonstrates OOP principles, collision detection, real-time animation, and level progression. The player (turtle) must dodge moving cars and reach the finish line to level up. Speed increases with each level, and the game ends upon collision.

## Key Features:

* Used Python's built-in turtle module for graphics and animation.

* Applied object-oriented programming with custom classes: Player, CarManager, and Scoreboard for modular code structure.

* Implemented real-time game mechanics using loops, randomization, and keyboard controls.

* Implemented dynamic level scaling with increasing car speed.

* Used turtle, random, and real-time loops for game interaction.

* Added level system with increasing difficulty.

* Game Over trigger on collision, with live scoreboard updates


## What I built: 
*  Object-oriented design with separate classes for Player, Cars, and Scoreboard
*  Real-time collision detection & animations
*  Keyboard-controlled movement
*  Dynamic difficulty (faster cars at each level)

## Skills Used:
Python | Turtle Graphics | OOP | Game Development | Basic Animation | Problem Solving |

## Conclusion:
This project strengthened my understanding of Python fundamentals, especially object-oriented programming, event-driven logic, and real-time game mechanics. It was a great way to combine creativity with coding and build something interactive from scratch. Iâ€™m excited to keep exploring more advanced Python projects and game development concepts!
